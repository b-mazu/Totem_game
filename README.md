LIGHT UP
===============

Game created with Java and libGDX framework. I started this project a long time ago, only after 1 week of learning Java . It ended up being created with only 2 classes (1 mega class :D) ...yet somehow I managed to do it. Looking at that now, I think it was too big project for me back then, with me literally lacking basics...
In the end I managed to make it playable on Android and Desktop.

Game  has 16 pre defined maps of 5x5 matrix Lights (Red and Green). Game rules are simple. Your job is to make all lights ended up Green by clicking them. The trick part in this, is that, whenever you click one of them, it changes its color to opposite (Red to Green or Green to Red), and the color of opposite Lights near the one you clicked. So it's kinda logical puzzle game.
